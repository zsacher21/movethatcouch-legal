<main>

<p>
This Privacy Policy explains how MOVE THAT COUCH! (“we,” “us,” or “our”) collects,
uses, and protects information when you use the MOVE THAT COUCH! mobile application
and related services (“the platform”). By creating an account or using the platform,
you agree to this Policy.
</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
<p>When you create an account, we may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Email address</li>
  <li>Phone number</li>
  <li>Profile photo (optional)</li>
  <li>Payout method for referral bonuses (Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal – no CashApp)</li>
  <li>
    Service area center points and delivery radiuses (for drivers), used to determine
    which delivery requests you can see
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>1.2 Delivery Information</h3>
<p>When you create or accept a delivery, we may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pickup and drop-off addresses and approximate locations</li>
  <li>Item descriptions and photos</li>
  <li>Preferred delivery dates or time windows</li>
  <li>Quotes sent and received</li>
  <li>Booking deposit status and related transaction details</li>
  <li>In-app chat messages between customers and drivers</li>
</ul>

<h3>1.3 Technical Information</h3>
<p>
We may automatically collect limited technical information, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device type and operating system</li>
  <li>Browser type and version (for web views)</li>
  <li>IP address and general region</li>
  <li>Basic usage information, like which screens are viewed and actions taken</li>
</ul>

<p>
This information is used to operate, secure, and improve the platform.
We do not use it for third-party targeted advertising.
</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>

<p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
  <li>Connect customers with drivers and manage delivery requests</li>
  <li>Process booking deposits and referral payouts</li>
  <li>Enable and support in-app messaging</li>
  <li>
    Send transactional communications, including booking confirmations,
    delivery updates, reminders, security alerts, and account-related notifications
    via in-app messaging, email, and SMS where enabled
  </li>
  <li>Provide customer support and respond to inquiries</li>
  <li>Maintain and improve the safety, performance, and reliability of the platform</li>
  <li>Detect, investigate, and prevent fraud, abuse, or misuse</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not sell personal information and do not share it with third parties
for their own marketing purposes.
</p>

<h2>3. In-App Messaging & Contact Details</h2>

<p>
To protect user privacy, customers and drivers communicate through MOVE THAT COUCH!
messaging tools rather than directly sharing contact details.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Phone numbers and email addresses are not shared directly between users</li>
  <li>
    We may review messages or related data when necessary to investigate safety,
    abuse, or fraud concerns, or to comply with legal obligations
  </li>
  <li>
    If you update your account information while a delivery is in progress,
    the platform may continue using the information originally associated with that
    delivery until the job is completed to avoid confusion or disruption
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Email & SMS Notifications</h2>

<p>
MOVE THAT COUCH! may send transactional notifications via email and SMS to support
platform functionality, including booking confirmations, delivery updates, reminders,
security alerts, and customer support messages.
</p>

<p>
SMS messages may be used as a fallback or supplemental notification method when enabled,
such as when in-app notifications are unavailable or when time-sensitive delivery updates
are required.
</p>

<p>
Message frequency varies based on user activity. Standard message and data rates may apply.
</p>

<p>
You may opt out of SMS messages at any time by replying <strong>STOP</strong>.
Opting out of SMS may limit your ability to receive time-sensitive delivery updates.
We do not send third-party marketing messages via SMS.
</p>

<h2>5. Payments & Referral Payouts</h2>

<p>
MOVE THAT COUCH! processes only the 20% booking deposit for deliveries through the platform.
The remaining 80% is paid directly to the driver, outside the app.
</p>

<p>
Deposits may be processed by third-party payment providers (such as Stripe).
These providers receive the information necessary to process payments,
such as card details and billing data. We do not store full credit card numbers
on our own servers.
</p>

<p>
For referral payouts, we store the payout handle you provide (for Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal)
and use it only to send referral bonuses when you are eligible under the referral program rules.
</p>

<h2>6. Location Information</h2>

<p>
For customers, we use pickup and drop-off addresses and approximate locations
only to support your specific delivery requests and to show relevant information
to potential drivers.
</p>

<p>
For drivers, we use service area center points and radiuses you set to determine
which delivery requests are shown to you.
</p>

<p>
Before a quote is accepted and a deposit is paid, drivers may see only an approximate
location for a job. After acceptance, exact addresses are shared with the matched
driver so the delivery can be completed.
</p>

<h2>7. How We Share Information</h2>

<h3>7.1 With Other Users as Needed for Deliveries</h3>
<p>To support deliveries, we may share:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Names and profile photos (if provided)</li>
  <li>Pickup and drop-off locations and relevant delivery details</li>
  <li>In-app messaging content between the matched customer and driver</li>
</ul>

<h3>7.2 With Service Providers</h3>
<p>
We may share information with third-party service providers that help us operate
the platform, such as hosting services, payment processors, analytics tools,
email delivery services, SMS messaging providers, and customer support tools.
</p>

<p>
These providers may use information only to perform services on our behalf
and must handle it appropriately.
</p>

<h3>7.3 For Legal and Safety Reasons</h3>
<p>
We may disclose information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes</li>
  <li>Respond to lawful requests from authorities</li>
  <li>Protect the rights, property, or safety of MOVE THAT COUCH!, our users, or others</li>
</ul>

<p>We do not sell personal information to third parties.</p>

<h2>8. Data Retention</h2>

<p>
We keep information for as long as reasonably necessary to operate the platform,
comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
</p>

<p>
You may request deletion of your account, but we may retain certain information
where required by law, for legitimate business purposes (such as payment records,
security logs, or fraud prevention), or in an aggregated and de-identified form.
</p>

<h2>9. Security</h2>

<p>
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information.
However, no system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.
</p>

<h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>

<p>
MOVE THAT COUCH! is not intended for children under 18.
We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors.
</p>

<h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.
The most current version will be posted within the app and/or on this page.
Continued use of the platform after changes take effect constitutes acceptance
of the updated Policy.
</p>
