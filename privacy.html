    <div class="updated">Last updated: January 2026</div>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how MOVE THAT COUCH! (“we,” “us,” or “our”)
      collects, uses, and protects information when you use the MOVE THAT COUCH!
      mobile application and related services (“the platform”). By creating an
      account or using the platform, you agree to this Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

      <li>Payout method for referral bonuses (Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal – no CashApp)</li>
      <li>
        Service area center points and delivery radiuses (for drivers), used to
        determine which delivery requests you can see
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Delivery Information</h3>

      <li>Booking deposit status and related transaction details</li>
      <li>In-app chat messages between customers and drivers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Technical Information</h3>
    <p>
      We may automatically collect limited technical information, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type and operating system</li>
      <li>Browser type and version (for web views)</li>
      <li>IP address and general region</li>
      <li>Basic usage information, like which screens are viewed and actions taken</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is used to operate, secure, and improve the platform. We
      do not use it for third-party targeted advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
      <li>Connect customers with drivers and manage delivery requests</li>
      <li>Process booking deposits and referral payouts</li>
      <li>Enable and support in-app messaging</li>
      <li>Provide customer support and respond to inquiries</li>
      <li>Maintain and improve the safety, performance, and reliability of the platform</li>
      <li>Detect, investigate, and prevent fraud, abuse, or misuse</li>
      <li>
        Use photos and other user-submitted content to operate, improve, and
        promote the platform, as described in our Terms of Service
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do not sell personal information and do not share it with third parties
      for their own marketing purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When photos or other content are used outside of a specific delivery
      context, we take reasonable steps to avoid including personal contact
      details and may anonymize or redact information where appropriate.
    </p>

    <h2>3. In-App Messaging & Contact Details</h2>
    <p>
      To protect user privacy, customers and drivers communicate through MOVE
      THAT COUCH! messaging tools rather than directly sharing contact details.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Phone numbers and email addresses are not shared directly between users through the platform.</li>
      <li>
        We may review messages or related data when necessary to investigate
        safety, abuse, or fraud concerns, or to comply with legal obligations.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you update your account information while a delivery is in progress,
        the platform may continue using the information originally associated
        with that delivery until the job is completed to avoid confusion or
        disruption.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Email & SMS Notifications</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! may send transactional notifications via email and SMS to
      support platform functionality. These messages may include booking
      confirmations, delivery updates, reminders, security alerts, and customer
      support communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      SMS messages may be used as a fallback or supplemental notification method
      when email or in-app notifications are unavailable or time-sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not send promotional or marketing SMS messages. Message frequency
      varies based on user activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may opt out of SMS messages at any time by replying <strong>STOP</strong>.
      For help, reply <strong>HELP</strong>. Standard message and data rates may apply.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Payments & Referral Payouts</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! processes only the 20% booking deposit for deliveries
      through the platform. The remaining 80% is paid directly to the driver,
      outside the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deposits may be processed by third-party payment providers (such as Stripe).
      These providers receive the information necessary to process payments, such
      as card details and billing data. We do not store full credit card numbers
      on our own servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For referral payouts, we store the payout handle you provide (for Venmo,
      Zelle, or PayPal) and use it only to send referral bonuses when you are
      eligible under the referral program rules.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Location Information</h2>
    <p>
      For customers, we use pickup and drop-off addresses and approximate
      locations only to support your specific delivery requests and to show
      relevant information to potential drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For drivers, we use service area center points and radiuses you set to
      determine which delivery requests are shown to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before a quote is accepted and a deposit is paid, drivers may see only an
      approximate location. After acceptance, exact addresses are shared with the
      matched driver so the delivery can be completed.
    </p>

    <h2>7. How We Share Information</h2>

    <h3>7.1 With Other Users</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Names and profile photos (if provided)</li>
      <li>Pickup and drop-off locations and relevant delivery details</li>
      <li>In-app messaging content between the matched customer and driver</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7.2 With Service Providers</h3>
    <p>
      We may share information with third-party service providers that help us
      operate the platform, such as hosting services, payment processors,
      analytics tools, and customer support tools. These providers may use
      information only to perform services on our behalf.
    </p>

    <h3>7.3 Legal and Safety Reasons</h3>
    <p>
      We may disclose information if reasonably necessary to comply with law,
      respond to lawful requests, or protect the rights, safety, or property of
      MOVE THAT COUCH! or others.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We keep information for as long as reasonably necessary to operate the
      platform, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our
      agreements.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to
      protect information. No system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is not intended for children under 18, and we do not
      knowingly collect personal information from minors.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the
      platform after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated
      Policy.
    </p>
