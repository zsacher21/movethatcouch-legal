      We do not use it for third-party targeted advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
      <li>Connect customers with drivers and manage delivery requests</li>
      <li>
        Process booking deposits, deposit refunds, late cancellation payouts,

      <li>Maintain and improve platform safety, performance, and reliability</li>
      <li>Detect, investigate, and prevent fraud, abuse, or misuse</li>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We do not sell personal information and do not share it with third parties
      for their own marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      When photos or other content are used outside of a specific delivery
      context, we take reasonable steps to avoid including personal contact
      details and may anonymize or redact information where appropriate.
    </p>

    <h2>3. In-App Messaging & Contact Details</h2>
    <p>
      To protect user privacy, customers and drivers communicate through
      MOVE THAT COUCH! messaging tools rather than directly sharing contact
      details.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Phone numbers and email addresses are not shared directly between users
        through the platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        We may review messages or related data when necessary to investigate
        safety, abuse, or fraud concerns, or to comply with legal obligations.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you update your account information while a delivery is in progress,
        the platform may continue using the information originally associated
        with that delivery until the job is completed to avoid confusion or
        disruption.
      </li>
    </ul>

   <h2>4. Email, Push & SMS Notifications</h2>

<p>
  MOVE THAT COUCH! uses email, push notifications, and SMS messages to provide
  <strong>transactional communications</strong> that support platform functionality.
  These communications may include account activity, delivery requests, booking
  confirmations, driver updates, delivery status notifications, cancellations,
  reminders, and customer support messages.
</p>

<p>
  Push notifications and email notifications may be enabled by default and are used
  solely for transactional purposes. Users can manage their notification preferences
  for email and push notifications at any time through their account settings within
  the app.
</p>

<p>
  Push notifications are delivered through device and operating system notification services and do not require a phone number.
</p>

<p>
  SMS notifications are <strong>optional</strong> and are sent only after a user
  explicitly opts in by enabling SMS notifications and providing a valid phone number
  within the app. SMS messages may be used as a primary, fallback, or supplemental
  notification method when email or push notifications are unavailable or
  time-sensitive.
</p>

<p>
  MOVE THAT COUCH! does <strong>not</strong> send marketing, advertising, or promotional
  SMS messages. Message frequency varies based on user activity.
</p>

<p>
  Users may opt out of SMS messages at any time by replying
  <strong>STOP</strong>. For assistance, users may reply <strong>HELP</strong>.
  Standard message and data rates may apply.
</p>

<h3>4.1 Third-Party Delivery Contacts</h3>

<p>
  Users managing deliveries on behalf of a client may provide the client’s phone number
  so the client can receive transactional notifications related solely to that specific
  delivery. By providing a client’s phone number, the user represents that they have
  obtained the client’s permission to receive such messages.
</p>

<p>
  MOVE THAT COUCH! does not send marketing or promotional messages to third-party
  delivery contacts, and client contact information is used only for delivery
  coordination and status updates.
</p>

    <h2>5. Payments</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! processes only the <strong>20% booking deposit</strong>
      through the platform using Stripe. The remaining portion of the accepted
      quote (typically 80%) is paid directly by the customer to the driver
      outside of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stripe also processes deposit refunds, late cancellation fees paid to
      drivers, and referral bonuses paid to users.
      We do not store full credit card or bank account numbers on our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Location Information</h2>
    <p>
      Pickup and drop-off addresses and approximate locations are used only
      to support delivery requests and matching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drivers may see approximate locations before a quote is accepted.
      Exact addresses are shared only after acceptance so the delivery can
      be completed.
    </p>

    <h2>7. How We Share Information</h2>

    <h3>7.1 With Other Users</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Names and profile photos (if provided)</li>
  <li>
    Business names or operating names (if provided), which may be displayed
    instead of or in addition to personal names
  </li>
  <li>
    Public profile information (if provided), such as bios or descriptions
    users choose to share
  </li>
  <li>
    Additional profile photos (if provided), such as images of vehicles,
    equipment, or storefronts
  </li>
  <li>
    User ratings and reviews submitted after completed deliveries
  </li>
  <li>
    Pickup and drop-off locations and relevant delivery details
  </li>
  <li>
    In-app messaging content between matched users
  </li>
</ul>

    <h3>7.2 With Service Providers</h3>
    <p>
      We may share information with service providers that help operate the
      platform, such as hosting, payment processing, analytics, and customer
      support services. These providers may use information only to perform
      services on our behalf.
    </p>

    <h3>7.3 Legal and Safety Reasons</h3>
    <p>
      We may disclose information when reasonably necessary to comply with law,
      respond to lawful requests, or protect the rights, safety, or property of
      MOVE THAT COUCH! or others.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Ratings & Reviews</h2>

<p>
  After a delivery is completed, customers and drivers may be prompted to rate
  and review one another. Ratings and reviews are visible to other users and are
  intended to help promote trust, transparency, and accountability on the platform.
</p>

<p>
  Ratings and reviews are provided by users and reflect their personal experiences.
  MOVE THAT COUCH! does not independently verify the accuracy of user-submitted
  ratings or review content.
</p>

<p>
  User ratings and review history may be considered when determining a user’s
  eligibility to continue using the platform, access certain features, or receive
  delivery opportunities.
</p>

<p>
  With reasonable safeguards such as anonymization or user consent, MOVE THAT COUCH!
  may display selected ratings or reviews on the platform or on related marketing
  materials to illustrate user experiences. We do not publish private contact
  information alongside reviews.
</p>


    <h2>9. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain information as reasonably necessary to operate the platform,
      comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to
      protect information. No system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is not intended for children under 18, and we do not
      knowingly collect personal information from minors.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the
      platform after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated
      Policy.
