    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: December 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how MOVE THAT COUCH! (“we,” “us,” or “our”)
      collects, uses, and protects information when you use the MOVE THAT COUCH!
      mobile application and related services (“the platform”). By creating an
      account or using the platform, you agree to this Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Account Information</h3>
    <p>When you create an account, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Phone number</li>
      <li>Profile photo (optional)</li>
      <li>
        Payout method for referral bonuses (Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal – no CashApp)
      </li>
      <li>
        Service area center points and delivery radiuses (for drivers), used to
        determine which delivery requests you can see.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.2 Delivery Information</h3>
    <p>When you create or accept a delivery, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Pickup and drop-off addresses and approximate locations</li>
      <li>Item descriptions and photos</li>
      <li>Preferred delivery dates or time windows</li>
      <li>Quotes sent and received</li>
      <li>Booking deposit status and related transaction details</li>
      <li>In-app chat messages between customers and drivers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3 Technical Information</h3>
    <p>We may automatically collect limited technical information, such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Device type and operating system</li>
      <li>Browser type and version (for web views)</li>
      <li>IP address and general region</li>
      <li>Basic usage information, like which screens are viewed and actions taken</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This information is used to operate, secure, and improve the platform. We
      do <strong>not</strong> use it for third-party targeted advertising.
    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
      <li>Connect customers with drivers and manage delivery requests</li>
      <li>Process booking deposits and referral payouts</li>
      <li>Enable and support in-app messaging</li>
      <li>Provide customer support and respond to inquiries</li>
      <li>
        Maintain and improve the safety, performance, and reliability of the platform
      </li>
      <li>Detect, investigate, and prevent fraud, abuse, or misuse</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal information and do
      <strong>not</strong> share it with third parties for their own marketing
      purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>3. In-App Messaging & Contact Details</h2>
    <p>
      To protect user privacy, customers and drivers communicate through
      MOVE THAT COUCH! messaging tools rather than directly sharing contact details.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Phone numbers and email addresses are <strong>not shared</strong> directly
        between users through the platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        We may review messages or related data when necessary to investigate safety,
        abuse, or fraud concerns, or to comply with legal obligations.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you update your account information while a delivery is in progress, the
        platform may continue using the information originally associated with that
        delivery until the job is completed to avoid confusion or disruption.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Payments & Referral Payouts</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! processes only the <strong>20% booking deposit</strong>
      for deliveries through the platform. The remaining 80% is paid directly to
      the driver, outside the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deposits may be processed by third-party payment providers (such as Stripe).
      These providers receive the information necessary to process payments, such
      as card details and billing data. We do not store full credit card numbers
      on our own servers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For referral payouts, we store the payout handle you provide (for Venmo,
      Zelle, or PayPal) and use it only to send referral bonuses when you are
      eligible under the referral program rules.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Location Information</h2>
    <p>
      For customers, we use pickup and drop-off addresses and approximate
      locations only to support your specific delivery requests and to show
      relevant information to potential drivers.
    </p>
    <p>
      For drivers, we use “service area center points” and radiuses you set to
      determine which delivery requests are shown to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before a quote is accepted and a deposit is paid, drivers may see only
      an approximate location for a job. After acceptance, exact addresses are
      shared with the matched driver so the delivery can be completed.
    </p>

    <h2>6. How We Share Information</h2>

    <h3>6.1 With Other Users as Needed for Deliveries</h3>
    <p>To support deliveries, we may share:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Names and profile photos (if provided)</li>
      <li>Pickup and drop-off locations and relevant delivery details</li>
      <li>In-app messaging content between the matched customer and driver</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>6.2 With Service Providers</h3>
    <p>
      We may share information with third-party service providers that help us
      operate the platform, such as hosting services, payment processors, analytics
      tools, and customer support tools. These providers are allowed to use
      information only to perform services on our behalf and must handle it
      appropriately.
    </p>

    <h3>6.3 For Legal and Safety Reasons</h3>
    <p>
      We may disclose information if we believe it is reasonably necessary to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Comply with applicable laws, regulations, or legal processes</li>
      <li>Respond to lawful requests from authorities</li>
      <li>
        Protect the rights, property, or safety of MOVE THAT COUCH!, our users,
        or others
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We do <strong>not</strong> sell personal information to third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We keep information for as long as reasonably necessary to operate the
      platform, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce
      our agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may request deletion of your account, but we may retain certain
      information where required by law, for legitimate business purposes
      (such as payment records, security logs, or fraud prevention), or in an
      aggregated and de-identified form.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to
      protect information. However, no system can be guaranteed to be completely
      secure. You use the platform at your own risk and are responsible for
      maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is not intended for children under 18, and we do not
      knowingly collect personal information from minors. If we learn that a
      minor has created an account, we may delete the account and related data.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current
      version will be posted within the app and/or on this page. If we make
      material changes, we may provide additional notice as appropriate.
      Continued use of the platform after changes take effect constitutes
      acceptance of the updated Policy.
    </p>
