Connect customers with drivers

Process booking deposits

Send referral bonuses

Facilitate in-app messaging

Improve app performance and reliability

Prevent fraud or misuse of the platform

We do not sell your data and do not use it for targeted advertising.

3. In-App Messaging & Privacy

To protect privacy:

Phone numbers and email addresses are never shared with other users

All communication is routed through in-app messaging only

Messages may be monitored or reviewed if needed to enforce safety or prevent abuse

If a user updates their account information while a delivery is in progress, the platform will continue using the information associated with that delivery until the job is completed

This ensures deliveries are not disrupted by mid-job changes.

4. Payments & Deposits

MOVE THAT COUCH! processes only the 20% booking deposit through the platform.

The deposit is paid to MOVE THAT COUCH! on completed jobs

The remaining 80% is paid directly to the driver, outside the app

Payment details for Venmo/Zelle/PayPal are collected only for referral payouts

We do not store or process full credit card numbers; payments are handled by third-party providers (e.g., Stripe)

5. Referral Program Information

If you participate in the referral program, we store:

Who referred whom

Referral payout method

Whether a first job was completed

No referral bonus is paid if a job is canceled or not completed.

6. Location Information

For customers:

Pickup and drop-off addresses are used only for the delivery you request.

For drivers:

“Service area center points” and radiuses help determine which requests you see.

Exact addresses are shared only after a customer accepts a quote and pays the deposit.

Before acceptance, drivers see only an approximate location.

7. How We Share Information

We only share information in the following situations:

7.1 To complete a delivery

Customers and drivers see each other’s names, profile photos (if added), and necessary delivery details

Exact addresses are shared only after a quote is accepted

7.2 Service Providers

We may share information with:

Payment processors

Hosting providers

Customer support tools

They may only use this information to perform services on our behalf.

7.3 Legal Requirements

We may disclose information if required to do so by law, regulation, or court order.

We do not sell personal information to third parties.

8. Data Retention

We retain data only as long as necessary to:

Maintain your account

Comply with legal requirements

Resolve disputes

Enforce platform rules

You may request that we delete your account data at any time, subject to required retention (e.g., payments, fraud prevention).

9. Security

We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect information.
However, no online platform is perfectly secure, and users agree to use MOVE THAT COUCH! at their own risk.

10. Children’s Privacy

MOVE THAT COUCH! is not intended for children under 18.
We do not knowingly collect information from minors.

11. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Policy from time to time. The most current version will always be available on our website and within the app.
