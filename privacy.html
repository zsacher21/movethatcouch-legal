    </p>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Create and manage user accounts</li>
      <li>Connect customers with drivers and manage delivery requests</li>
      <li>
        Process booking deposits, deposit refunds, late cancellation payouts,

      </li>
      <li>Enable and support in-app messaging</li>
      <li>Provide customer support and respond to inquiries</li>
      <li>Maintain and improve platform safety, performance, and reliability</li>
      <li>Detect, investigate, and prevent fraud, abuse, or misuse</li>
      <li>
        Use photos and other user-submitted content to operate, improve, and
        promote the platform, as described in our Terms of Service
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We do not sell personal information and do not share it with third parties
      for their own marketing purposes.
    </p>

    <p>
      When photos or other content are used outside of a specific delivery
      context, we take reasonable steps to avoid including personal contact
      details and may anonymize or redact information where appropriate.
    </p>

    <h2>3. In-App Messaging & Contact Details</h2>
    <p>
      To protect user privacy, customers and drivers communicate through
      MOVE THAT COUCH! messaging tools rather than directly sharing contact
      details.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Phone numbers and email addresses are not shared directly between users
        through the platform.
      </li>
      <li>
        We may review messages or related data when necessary to investigate
        safety, abuse, or fraud concerns, or to comply with legal obligations.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you update your account information while a delivery is in progress,
        the platform may continue using the information originally associated
        with that delivery until the job is completed to avoid confusion or
        disruption.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Email & SMS Notifications</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! may send transactional notifications via email and SMS
      to support platform functionality, including booking confirmations,
      delivery updates, reminders, security alerts, and customer support
      communications.
    </p>
    <p>
      SMS messages may be used as a fallback or supplemental notification method
      when email or in-app notifications are unavailable or time-sensitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not send promotional or marketing SMS messages.
      Message frequency varies based on user activity.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may opt out of SMS messages at any time by replying
      <strong>STOP</strong>. For help, reply <strong>HELP</strong>.
      Standard message and data rates may apply.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Payments</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! processes only the <strong>20% booking deposit</strong>
      through the platform using Stripe. The remaining portion of the accepted
      quote (typically 80%) is paid directly by the customer to the driver
      outside of the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stripe also processes deposit refunds, late cancellation fees paid to
      drivers, and referral bonuses paid to users.
      We do not store full credit card or bank account numbers on our servers.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Location Information</h2>
    <p>
      Pickup and drop-off addresses and approximate locations are used only
      to support delivery requests and matching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drivers may see approximate locations before a quote is accepted.
      Exact addresses are shared only after acceptance so the delivery can
      be completed.
    </p>

    <h2>7. How We Share Information</h2>

    <h3>7.1 With Other Users</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Names and profile photos (if provided)</li>
      <li>Pickup and drop-off locations and relevant delivery details</li>
      <li>In-app messaging content between matched users</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>7.2 With Service Providers</h3>
    <p>
      We may share information with service providers that help operate the
      platform, such as hosting, payment processing, analytics, and customer
      support services. These providers may use information only to perform
      services on our behalf.
    </p>

    <h3>7.3 Legal and Safety Reasons</h3>
    <p>
      We may disclose information when reasonably necessary to comply with law,
      respond to lawful requests, or protect the rights, safety, or property of
      MOVE THAT COUCH! or others.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain information as reasonably necessary to operate the platform,
      comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to
      protect information. No system can be guaranteed to be completely secure.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is not intended for children under 18, and we do not
      knowingly collect personal information from minors.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the
      platform after changes take effect constitutes acceptance of the updated
      Policy.
