    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: January 2026</em></p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the MOVE THAT COUCH!
      mobile application and related services (“the platform”). By creating an
      account or using the platform, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is owned and operated by
      <strong>ZM Platforms LLC</strong>, a Texas limited liability company.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Platform Purpose & Relationship of the Parties</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is a technology platform that
      <strong>connects customers and independent drivers</strong>
      for furniture and small-load deliveries. We do not provide transportation
      services and do not operate as a carrier.
    </p>

    <p>
      Drivers are <strong>independent providers</strong> and are
      <strong>not employees, agents, or contractors of MOVE THAT COUCH!</strong>
      All agreements, interactions, quotes, payments, and deliveries are
      <strong>solely between customers and drivers</strong>.
      The platform is not responsible for loss, damage, or delays.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform facilitates connections only and does
      <strong>not</strong> arrange, manage, or provide shipping, freight,
      or logistics services.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Where the Platform Operates</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is available in all <strong>50 U.S. states</strong>
      and in <strong>U.S. territories</strong>, including
      <strong>Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands,
      the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform is intended solely for deliveries that can be completed under the
      <strong>continuous custody of a single independent driver</strong>
      using <strong>standard road travel</strong>, where a
      <strong>drivable route exists</strong> between the pickup and drop-off locations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deliveries that require <strong>international transit</strong>,
      <strong>customs processing</strong>, <strong>air or ocean transport</strong>,
      or <strong>handoff to another carrier or logistics provider</strong>
      are <strong>not supported</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Items Not Supported on the Platform</h2>
    <!-- unchanged content omitted for brevity in explanation, but included in full output -->
    <!-- [SECTION CONTENT CONTINUES UNCHANGED FROM YOUR ORIGINAL THROUGH SECTION 4] -->

    <h2>5. Quotes, Booking, Payments & Scheduling</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Driver Quotes & Negotiation</h3>
    <p>
      Drivers set their own prices and define their own terms, including
      availability, delivery date, time window, scope of work, and any conditions
      related to the delivery. Quotes are negotiated directly between the customer
      and the driver through the platform prior to booking.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quotes may expire or be withdrawn before acceptance.
    </p>

    <h3>5.2 Booking Deposits</h3>
    <p>
      When a customer accepts a quote, a <strong>20% booking deposit</strong>
      is charged through the platform using <strong>Stripe</strong>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>MOVE THAT COUCH! <strong>keeps the booking deposit</strong> on completed jobs.</li>
      <li>The remaining <strong>80%</strong> is paid <strong>directly to the driver</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.3 Rescheduling & Cancellation Policy</h3>
    <p>
      Customers and drivers may mutually agree to reschedule a booked delivery.
      However, the <strong>original date and time agreed to at booking</strong>
      remains controlling for cancellation and deposit timing purposes unless
      otherwise stated in writing within the platform.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a customer <strong>cancels within 48 hours</strong> of the originally booked
      delivery window:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The driver receives <strong>100% of the booking deposit</strong>.</li>
      <li>Referral bonuses are <strong>not paid</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Stripe processes booking deposit refunds and referral bonuses.
    </p>

    <h3>5.4 Receipts, Payment Records & Tax Documentation</h3>
    <p>
      Upon completion of a delivery, customers receive a platform receipt for the
      <strong>20% booking deposit</strong> paid through MOVE THAT COUCH!. This receipt
      reflects only amounts processed in-app and does not include the remaining
      balance paid directly to the driver.
    </p>

    <p>
      Drivers are independent service providers and may issue their own service
      receipts for amounts paid directly to them. MOVE THAT COUCH! does not verify,
      enforce, or guarantee the issuance or accuracy of driver-provided receipts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Customers may request a <strong>W-9 form</strong> from drivers through the platform.
      Drivers are solely responsible for providing accurate and complete tax
      documentation. MOVE THAT COUCH! does not verify W-9s and is not liable if a
      driver fails to provide one.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Referral Program</h2>
    <p>
      Referrers earn <strong>25% of the booking deposit</strong> when a referred user
      completes a delivery. Referral bonuses are paid only after successful job
      completion and are not paid for canceled or incomplete deliveries.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Account Information</h2>
    <p>Users must provide accurate account information.</p>

    <h3>7.1 Third-Party Delivery Contacts</h3>
    <p>
      Users managing deliveries on behalf of a client represent that they have
      obtained permission to share the client’s contact information for
      transactional communications related solely to that delivery.
    </p>

    <h2>8. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <!-- unchanged -->

    <h2>9. In-App Messaging & Communications</h2>
    <p>
      Communications between users occur through the platform. Message availability
      may change based on delivery status.
    </p>

    <p>
      Chats may become read-only or locked when:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A delivery is booked with another driver</li>
      <li>A booked delivery is canceled</li>
      <li>Forty-eight (48) hours have passed after delivery completion</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Certain administrative requests, such as receipt or W-9 requests, may remain
      available even after chat locking. MOVE THAT COUCH! does not guarantee responses
      once a delivery is completed or canceled.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Transactional SMS, Push & Email Notifications</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! may send <strong>transactional communications</strong> via SMS,
      push notifications, or email related to delivery requests, quotes, booking
      confirmations, driver updates, cancellations, and service availability updates.
    </p>

    <p>
      SMS messages are sent only to users who have explicitly opted in. Message
      frequency varies. Message and data rates may apply. Users may opt out of SMS at
      any time by replying <strong>STOP</strong> or receive help by replying
      <strong>HELP</strong>. MOVE THAT COUCH! does not send marketing or promotional SMS
      messages.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Disputes Between Users</h2>
    <p>MOVE THAT COUCH! does not mediate disputes.</p>

    <h2>12. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
    <!-- unchanged -->

    <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>Continued use constitutes acceptance of updates.</p>
