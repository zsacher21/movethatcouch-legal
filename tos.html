    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: January 2026</em></p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the MOVE THAT COUCH!
      mobile application and related services (“the platform”). By creating an
      account or using the platform, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <p>

    </p>

    <h2>1. Platform Purpose & Relationship of the Parties</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is a technology platform that
      <strong>connects customers and independent drivers</strong> for
      furniture and small-load deliveries. We do not provide transportation
      services and do not operate as a carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drivers are <strong>independent providers</strong> and are
      <strong>not employees, agents, or contractors of MOVE THAT COUCH!</strong>
      All agreements, interactions, quotes, payments, and deliveries are
      <strong>solely between customers and drivers</strong>. The platform is
      not responsible for loss, damage, or delays.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform facilitates connections only and does <strong>not</strong>
      arrange, manage, or provide shipping, freight, or logistics services.

      and American Samoa</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform is intended solely for deliveries that can be completed under the
      <strong>continuous custody of a single independent driver</strong> using
      <strong>standard road travel</strong>, where a <strong>drivable route exists</strong>
      between the pickup and drop-off locations without requiring transfer of the item
      to air cargo, ocean freight, shipping services, or other transportation providers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Deliveries that require <strong>international transit</strong>,
      <strong>customs processing</strong>, <strong>air or ocean transport</strong>, or
      <strong>handoff to another carrier or logistics provider</strong> are
      <strong>not supported</strong>, even if such locations are within the United States.
