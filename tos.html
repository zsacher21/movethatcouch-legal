    <h2>1. Platform Purpose & Relationship of the Parties</h2>

      for furniture and small-load deliveries. We do not provide transportation
      services and do not operate as a carrier.

    <p>
      Drivers are <strong>independent providers</strong> and are
      <strong>not employees, agents, or contractors of MOVE THAT COUCH!</strong>
      All agreements, interactions, quotes, payments, and deliveries are
      <strong>solely between customers and drivers</strong>.
      The platform is not responsible for loss, damage, or delays.
