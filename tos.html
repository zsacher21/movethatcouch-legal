    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: January 2026</em></p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the MOVE THAT COUCH!
      mobile application and related services (“the platform”). By creating an
      account or using the platform, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is owned and operated by
      <strong>ZM Platforms LLC</strong>, a Texas limited liability company.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Platform Purpose & Relationship of the Parties</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is a technology platform that
      <strong>connects customers and independent drivers</strong>
      for furniture and small-load deliveries. We do not provide transportation
      services and do not operate as a carrier.
    </p>

    <p>
      Drivers are <strong>independent providers</strong> and are
      <strong>not employees, agents, or contractors of MOVE THAT COUCH!</strong>
      All agreements, interactions, quotes, payments, and deliveries are
      <strong>solely between customers and drivers</strong>.
      The platform is not responsible for loss, damage, or delays.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform facilitates connections only and does
      <strong>not</strong> arrange, manage, or provide shipping, freight,
      or logistics services.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Where the Platform Operates</h2>
    <p>

      <strong>Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands,
      the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform is intended solely for deliveries that can be completed under the
      <strong>continuous custody of a single independent driver</strong>
      using <strong>standard road travel</strong>, where a
      <strong>drivable route exists</strong> between the pickup and drop-off locations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deliveries that require <strong>international transit</strong>,
      <strong>customs processing</strong>, <strong>air or ocean transport</strong>,
      or <strong>handoff to another carrier or logistics provider</strong>
      are <strong>not supported</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>

      independent driver.
    </p>

    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is <strong>not liable</strong> for property damage,
      loss, injury, or claims arising from deliveries or user interactions.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Quotes, Scheduling, Booking Deposits, and Payments</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Driver Quotes & Scheduling Terms</h3>
    <p>
      Drivers independently set their own prices, availability, and delivery
      terms, including proposed dates and time windows. Customers and drivers
      may negotiate price, date, time, and scope directly through the platform
      prior to booking.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quotes may expire if not accepted within the timeframe shown or may be
      withdrawn by the driver before acceptance.
    </p>

    <h3>5.2 Booking Deposits</h3>
    <p>
      When a customer accepts a quote, a <strong>20% booking deposit</strong>
      based on the accepted quote is charged through the platform using
      <strong>Stripe</strong>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>MOVE THAT COUCH! <strong>keeps the booking deposit</strong> on completed jobs.</li>
      <li>The remaining <strong>80%</strong> is paid <strong>directly to the driver</strong> by the customer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.3 Rescheduling & Cancellation Policy</h3>

<p>
  Customers and drivers may mutually agree to reschedule a booked delivery.
  However, for purposes of cancellation and refund eligibility, the
  <strong>original date and time agreed to at booking</strong> controls all
  cancellation logic.
</p>

<p>
  If a customer <strong>cancels more than 48 hours</strong> before the originally
  booked delivery date and time, the booking deposit is <strong>refunded to the customer</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  If a customer <strong>cancels within 48 hours</strong> of the originally booked
  delivery date and time, the <strong>driver receives 100% of the booking deposit</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  If a <strong>driver cancels</strong> a booked delivery for any reason, the
  booking deposit is <strong>automatically refunded to the customer</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Important timing rule:</strong> The 48-hour window is calculated from
  the accepted quote at booking, regardless of later discussions or rescheduling.
</p>

<p>
  Stripe processes booking deposit refunds and late cancellation payouts.
</p>

    <h2>6. Referral Program</h2>
<p>
  MOVE THAT COUCH! may offer a referral program that allows users to earn referral
  bonuses by inviting new customers or drivers to the platform.
</p>

<h3>6.1 How Referrals Work</h3>
<p>
  Referrals must occur through a user’s unique referral link or QR code provided within
  the platform. Referral tracking and bonus calculations are handled automatically by
  the platform.
</p>

<h3>6.2 Bonus Structure</h3>
<p>Referrers earn:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>25% of the booking deposit</strong> when a referred user completes their
    <strong>first eligible delivery</strong>; and
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>5% of the booking deposit</strong> for each <strong>subsequent eligible delivery</strong>
    completed by that referred user.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Referral bonuses are calculated based on the <strong>booking deposit only</strong> and do not apply
  to the total delivery price.
</p>

<h3>6.3 Eligibility</h3>
<p>
  Referral bonuses are paid only for <strong>completed deliveries</strong>. No referral bonus is paid for
  canceled, refunded, disputed, fraudulent, or otherwise ineligible transactions.
</p>
<p>
  Referrers must maintain an account in <strong>good standing</strong> at the time the referred delivery is
  completed in order to receive a referral bonus.
</p>

<h3>6.4 Self-Referrals and Abuse</h3>
<p>
  Referral bonuses are not paid in cases of self-referral or where the referrer and referred user
  share the same payout destination or otherwise appear to be the same person. MOVE THAT COUCH!
  reserves the right to withhold or deny referral bonuses in cases of suspected abuse, manipulation,
  duplicate accounts, or violation of these Terms.
</p>

<h3>6.5 Payouts</h3>
<p>
  Referral bonuses are paid through the platform’s designated payout provider. Users are responsible
  for maintaining accurate payout information and complying with any tax reporting obligations
  associated with referral earnings.

  The referral program is offered at the sole discretion of MOVE THAT COUCH!. We reserve the right to

  requirements, at any time for any reason, including but not limited to legal, regulatory, tax, or
  business considerations.
</p>
<p>
  Any changes will apply prospectively. Referral bonuses already earned for completed eligible
  deliveries prior to the effective date of such changes will not be affected.
</p>

<h3>6.7 No Guarantee</h3>
