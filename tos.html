    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: December 2025</em></p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the MOVE THAT COUCH!
      mobile application and related services (“the platform”). By creating an
      account or using the platform, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Platform Purpose & Relationship of the Parties</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is a technology platform that
      <strong>connects customers and independent drivers</strong> for
      furniture and small-load deliveries. We do not provide transportation
      services and do not operate as a carrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drivers are <strong>independent providers</strong> and are
      <strong>not employees, agents, or contractors of MOVE THAT COUCH!</strong>
      All agreements, interactions, quotes, payments, and deliveries are
      <strong>solely between customers and drivers</strong>. The platform is
      not responsible for loss, damage, or delays.
    </p>

    <h2>2. No Liability & No Insurance Provided</h2>
    <p>
      Customers may optionally declare the estimated value of their item, and
      drivers may optionally disclose whether they carry their own insurance.
      However:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>MOVE THAT COUCH! does <strong>not</strong> provide insurance.</li>
      <li>MOVE THAT COUCH! does <strong>not</strong> verify driver insurance.</li>
      <li>
        MOVE THAT COUCH! does <strong>not guarantee coverage of any kind</strong>.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By booking a delivery, you agree that MOVE THAT COUCH! is
      <strong>not liable</strong> for property damage, loss, personal injury,
      or any other claim arising from or related to a delivery, your use of the
      platform, or any interactions between customers and drivers.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Quotes, Booking Deposits, and Payments</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Driver Quotes</h3>
    <p>
      Drivers set their own prices and availability. Customers may receive
      multiple quotes for a delivery request. Quotes may expire if not accepted
      within the timeframe shown in the app or may be withdrawn by the driver
      before acceptance.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Booking Deposits</h3>
    <p>
      When a customer accepts a quote, a <strong>20% booking deposit</strong>
      based on the accepted quote is charged through the platform.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        MOVE THAT COUCH! <strong>keeps the booking deposit</strong> on completed
        jobs.
      </li>
      <li>
        The remaining <strong>80%</strong> of the accepted quote is paid
        <strong>directly to the driver</strong> by the customer at or after
        delivery, outside the app.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.3 Cancellation Policy</h3>
    <p>
      If a customer <strong>cancels within 48 hours</strong> of the agreed
      delivery window:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The driver receives <strong>100% of the booking deposit</strong>.</li>
      <li>Referral bonuses for that job are <strong>not paid</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If a customer cancels <strong>more than 48 hours</strong> before the
      delivery window, the booking deposit may be refunded at our discretion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Drivers may cancel for legitimate reasons (for example, vehicle breakdown,
      illness, or safety concerns). Repeated or unreasonable cancellations may
      result in review or suspension of the driver’s account.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Referral Program</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! offers referral bonuses for bringing new users to the
      platform under the then-current referral program rules.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Referrers earn <strong>25% of the booking deposit</strong> when a
        referred driver or customer completes their <strong>first job</strong>.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a shop refers both the customer and the driver for the same job,
        the shop may earn <strong>both</strong> referral bonuses for that job.
      </li>
      <li>
        No referral bonus is paid if the job is canceled or not completed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Referral payouts are issued only via
        <strong>Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal</strong> (no CashApp).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We may change or discontinue the referral program at any time, with or
      without notice, for future referrals.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Account Information</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to provide accurate and up-to-date information when you create
      an account, including:
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li>Phone number</li>
      <li>Email address</li>
      <li>Profile photo (optional)</li>

      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
