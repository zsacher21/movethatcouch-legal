    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: January 2026</em></p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the MOVE THAT COUCH!
      mobile application and related services (“the platform”). By creating an
      account or using the platform, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <p>

    <h2>1. Platform Purpose & Relationship of the Parties</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is a technology platform that
      <strong>connects customers and independent drivers</strong>
      for furniture and small-load deliveries. We do not provide transportation
      services and do not operate as a carrier.
    </p>

    <p>
      Drivers are <strong>independent providers</strong> and are
      <strong>not employees, agents, or contractors of MOVE THAT COUCH!</strong>
      All agreements, interactions, quotes, payments, and deliveries are
      <strong>solely between customers and drivers</strong>.
      The platform is not responsible for loss, damage, or delays.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform facilitates connections only and does
      <strong>not</strong> arrange, manage, or provide shipping, freight,
      or logistics services.
    </p>

    <h2>1.5 Where the Platform Operates</h2>
    <p>
      MOVE THAT COUCH! is available in all <strong>50 U.S. states</strong>
      and in <strong>U.S. territories</strong>, including
      <strong>Puerto Rico, Guam, the U.S. Virgin Islands,
      the Northern Mariana Islands, and American Samoa</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The platform is intended solely for deliveries that can be completed under the
      <strong>continuous custody of a single independent driver</strong>
      using <strong>standard road travel</strong>, where a
      <strong>drivable route exists</strong> between the pickup and drop-off locations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Deliveries that require <strong>international transit</strong>,
      <strong>customs processing</strong>, <strong>air or ocean transport</strong>,
      or <strong>handoff to another carrier or logistics provider</strong>
      are <strong>not supported</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>

      MOVE THAT COUCH! reserves the right to restrict or deny certain routes.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Driver Compliance, No Liability & No Insurance Provided</h2>
    <p>
      Drivers are solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws,
      including licensing, registration, and insurance requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
      Insurance information provided by drivers is
      <strong>self-reported</strong> and <strong>not verified</strong>.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Quotes, Booking Deposits, and Payments</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Driver Quotes</h3>
    <p>
      Drivers set their own prices. Quotes may expire or be withdrawn
      before acceptance.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 Booking Deposits</h3>
    <p>
      When a customer accepts a quote, a
      <strong>20% booking deposit</strong> is charged through the platform
      using <strong>Stripe</strong>.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>MOVE THAT COUCH! <strong>keeps the booking deposit</strong> on completed jobs.</li>
      <li>
        The remaining <strong>80%</strong> is paid
        <strong>directly to the driver</strong> by the customer,
        outside the app.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3.3 Cancellation Policy</h3>
    <p>
      If a customer <strong>cancels within 48 hours</strong> of the delivery window:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>The driver receives <strong>100% of the booking deposit</strong>.</li>
      <li>Referral bonuses are <strong>not paid</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <strong>Important timing rule:</strong> The 48-hour window is calculated
      from the <strong>accepted quote at the time of booking</strong>.
      Later reschedules or chat discussions do <strong>not</strong> change this.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stripe processes booking deposit refunds, late cancellation payouts,
      and referral bonuses.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Referral Program</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Referrers earn <strong>25% of the booking deposit</strong>
        when a referred user completes their first job.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a shop refers both parties, it may earn
        <strong>both</strong> referral bonuses.

      <li>No bonus is paid for canceled or incomplete jobs.</li>
